Variables - 

var - don't want to use it as much. Can cause conflicts
let - reassign values 

e.g.
let age = 30;

const - always use const unless you reassign the value

e.g. score in a game

primitative data types - directly assigned to memory
strings const name = 'john'
numbers const age = 30; 
boolean const isCool = true/false;
null x = null;
undefined y = undefined; let z;
symbol

COncatenation
console.log("My name is '+ name + ' and I am ' + age);

Template Strings

Check for the smallest value
Create two variables x & y
Write an if / else block
It should compare a number x to another number y
It should print ("x is greater than y") in the console
Or "x is smaller than y"
Or "x is equal to y"
Depending on the value of x and y
BONUS: Find the largest value out of x, y and z

Math.max()' is for finding the greatest value in a list
Math.ceil() this function will always round up to the nearest integer.

We need to imagine that when the function was called that the variables were passed as arguments to the function
