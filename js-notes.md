Steps for functions
1. run
2. call
3. invoke
4. execute

Functions are a set of code that performs a task
Can create a function to isolate everything we want to do

If statements 
Way of checking and filtering out what action we need to peform

script tag should go in the <head> section
<script src="myFile.js"></script>

console.log("Hey");
console is an object
log is a function of the console object
whenever we use a function, we require the brackets
or parantheses
with console.log, it will log the value
of anything that is inside of the brackets
that value is the argument (or the parameter)
If you want to log some text, use "quotation marks"
Otherwise, it will thinkk you have a variable named whatever
And try to log the value of that variable

console.log(red) //use the value of the variable 'red'
console.log("red")//use the value "red"

DIfferent kinds of brackets and their purposes
() called braces, parentheses or 'round brackets'
These are used for calling a function
You put the arguments for a function inside the bracketts

[] called 'square brackets'
Used for accessing the values inside arrays and sometimes objects

{} called braces or 'curly brackets'
used to seperate different code blocks from one another
Code blocks define the layout and structure of the code in our files

<> 'angle brackets'
We use these in C#, don't worry about these yet.

//A variable is a 'placeholder for data
//the value, is the data for a variable
//a value is data
let myAge = 28;
let adamsAge = 28;

console.log(myAge)
console.log(adamsAge)
console.log(21 + 7)

//What is a type?
//A type is one of a handful of different possible formats
//that data can be
console.log(typeof 28);

//Our most common types are 
//Number
console.log(typeof 1234)
console.log(typeof 12.78969)
console.log(typeof -1231);

//Strings
//Strings are a series of characters
//These are typically human readable
console.log(typeof "Hello")
console.log(typeof "1234")

//Boolean
console.log (typeof true);
console.log (typeof false);

//Undefinied
console.log(typeof undefined);

//Object = Dont worry about it yet
console.log (typeof console);
let myNewArray = [];
console.log(typeof myNewArray);
// JS are dictionaries/hashmaps

//Function
console.log(typeof console.log);

//Using the + operator
//As soon as a string gets involved, everything becomes strings

//Using any other operator
//It will all become numbers, most likely result in NaN
